# Here's what we have disabled:
# C0103 - invalid module name
# F0401 - unable to import
# R0903 - too-few-public-methods
# R0914 - too many local variables

# Default is to give warnings and return a non-zero error code on TODO, FIXME
#       (check defaults with pylint --generate-rcfile > /tmp/pylintrc)
# We aren't interested in those, but may be interested in CI failing on other
# warning values, so just disable them here
